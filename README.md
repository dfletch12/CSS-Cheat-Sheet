# Module 02 Mini-Project: CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

On this mini-project we worked together to build a
 webpage that will hold a collection of CSS snippets. 
 What better way to learn CSS than to build a knowledge base of CSS?

 We were given a starter code by one of our instructors to have a 
 foundation on how the webpage is going look therefore we decided to split the work.

 First we must unsterstand what is a snippet (in the context of coding). A snippet 
 is a piece of reusable code, and a CSS Snippet "CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) + Snippet" is a
  set of utilities and interactive examples for CSS3. 
  
  CSS Snippets or any code snippets are used to save time in development.
